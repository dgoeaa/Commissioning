# NITDA Email Template Library — Flow Contract

**Release** `nitda-ecm-ops-email-templates/2.1.0` · 20 templates · 640 px container · 640 px mobile breakpoint
**Brand** Deep Green `#05583B` (PANTONE 7484C) · Smart Green `#17B255` (PANTONE 354C) · Brand Black `#373435`
**Type** Outfit / Alwyn New (display) · Verdana (body) · Cascadia Mono (references)

Every dynamic value in every template is read as
`@{coalesce(outputs('Compose_Name'),'<fallback>')}`. A flow that sets nothing still
renders a complete, sensible email — the literal `@{...}` never reaches a recipient.
Pre-composed HTML row blocks are read as `@{coalesce(variables('varName'),'')}` and
collapse to an empty table body when unset.

## 2. Pre-composed HTML row variables (9)

Build these with `Append to string variable` inside an `Apply to each`. Each row must be a
complete `<tr>`. The row recipe below matches the schedule styling used in the templates —
copy it verbatim so composed rows are indistinguishable from the static ones.

| Variable | Used by | Columns expected |
|---|---|---|
| `varAttachmentRowsHTML` | DP-01 IP-03 IP-04 IP-05 IP-08 IP-09 IP-12 | see §3 |
| `varChainRowsHTML` | IP-01 IP-12 | see §3 |
| `varDueTodayRowsHTML` | IP-07 | see §3 |
| `varEnclosureRowsHTML` | IP-11 | see §3 |
| `varOverdueRowsHTML` | IP-07 | see §3 |
| `varRequestedItemsHTML` | DP-04 | see §3 |
| `varTaskRowsHTML` | IP-02 | see §3 |
| `varTimelineRowsHTML` | DP-06 | see §3 |
| `varUpcomingRowsHTML` | IP-07 | see §3 |

### 3. Canonical row expression

```
@{concat(
'<tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding:11px 12px;border-bottom:1px solid #E8E6E7;font-family:''Cascadia Mono'',Consolas,''Courier New'',monospace;font-size:12px;line-height:1.45;color:#373435;">',
items('Apply_to_each')?['Reference'],
'</td><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding:11px 12px;border-bottom:1px solid #E8E6E7;font-family:Verdana,Geneva,''DejaVu Sans'',sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:1.45;color:#373435;">',
items('Apply_to_each')?['Subject'],
'</td><td align="right" valign="top" style="padding:11px 12px;border-bottom:1px solid #E8E6E7;font-family:Verdana,Geneva,''DejaVu Sans'',sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:1.45;color:#373435;">',
items('Apply_to_each')?['Due'],
'</td></tr>')}
```

Initialise every row variable to an empty string before the loop. Sanitise any
submitter-supplied fragment upstream — the templates carry no client-side script and
must never be handed unescaped HTML from a public channel.

## 4. Priority palette (governed)

Compute once in a `Switch` on `Compose_Priority_Level` and let every template consume it.

| Level | `Compose_Priority_Color` | `_Bg` | `_Border` | `_Text` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Low | `#475467` | `#F2F4F7` | `#D0D5DD` | `#344054` |
| Normal | `#067647` | `#ECFDF3` | `#ABEFC6` | `#067647` |
| High | `#B54708` | `#FEF6EE` | `#F9DBAF` | `#B54708` |
| Urgent | `#B42318` | `#FEF3F2` | `#FECDCA` | `#B42318` |

Priority levels are the canonical four from `config/priority.config.js`. Legacy
vocabularies (P1–P4, Medium, UPPERCASE) must be normalised before the send.

## 5. Governed status vocabulary

Portal-facing templates must display only the governed public labels from
`config/status-vocabulary.config.js`: **Received · Validation · Under review ·
Action required · Approved · Declined · Withdrawn**. Internal stored values
(Pending / Accepted / Delegated / Declined / Archived) are mapped through
`governedStatusLabel()` before they are placed in `Compose_Status_Text` on any
message leaving the Agency.

## 6. Conditional status indicators

Eighteen of the twenty templates colour themselves from the status they are reporting.
The flow sets **one** token — `Compose_Status_Text` (or `Compose_Decision_Label` on
DP-05) — and the template resolves the accent rail, the badge fill, the badge border and
the badge text colour from it inside the HTML. No extra Compose, no `Switch`, no palette
tokens to keep in step.

The resolution is a nested `if(contains(...))` on the lower-cased status, so an
unrecognised or unset status lands in Neutral rather than breaking:

| Bucket | Matches (case-insensitive) | Accent / text | Fill | Border |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cleared | approved · accepted · completed · closed · archived · cleared | `#067647` | `#ECFDF3` | `#ABEFC6` |
| Adverse | declined · rejected · returned | `#B42318` | `#FEF3F2` | `#FECDCA` |
| Pressing | overdue · action required · awaiting information · escalated | `#B54708` | `#FEF6EE` | `#F9DBAF` |
| In hand | under review · in review · review · validation · processing · pending · pending action · delegated · open · in progress · logged | `#05583B` | `#E6EEEB` | `#CDDDD7` |
| Neutral | anything else, including an unset status | `#475467` | `#F2F4F7` | `#D0D5DD` |

Two carriers, both Outlook-safe:

- **Status badge** — an inline `<span>` with a `&#9679;` dot, the governed label in
  caps, and all three colours resolved conditionally.
- **Status rail** — a 4 px table cell to the left of the detail block, coloured with the
  bucket's accent. A table cell, not a CSS `border-left`, so Word-rendered Outlook keeps
  it; `font-size:0;line-height:0` stops the spacer collapsing.

`IP-11` (outbound letterhead correspondence) and `DP-02` (one-time code) carry no
indicator by design — neither reports a status.

## 7. Email-origin task assignment (IP-12)

`IP-12` is the single-task assignment for tasks raised from an email the Agency
received. It is not IP-03: IP-03 announces that a mailbox item became a task, IP-12 is a
full assignment notice that additionally carries the provenance of the email it came from
— sender, organisation, address, mailbox, hour of receipt, message id, subject as
received, and an excerpt of the message as it arrived. Batch language is absent by
design; there is one matter and one officer.

| Token | Fallback | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Compose_Source_Sender_Name` | — | Person who wrote in. Also in the subject line. |
| `Compose_Source_Sender_Org` | — | Their organisation, under the name. |
| `Compose_Source_Sender_Email` | — | Reply-to address of record. |
| `Compose_Source_Mailbox` | — | Agency mailbox that received it. |
| `Compose_Source_Received_At` | — | Hour of receipt — the clock the officer is answering to. |
| `Compose_Source_Message_Id` | — | Mailbox message id, for retrieval and audit. |
| `Compose_Source_Thread_Excerpt` | (no excerpt available) | The message as it arrived. Sanitise upstream. |
| `Compose_Source_Attachment_Count` | 0 | Attachments carried onto the task. |

Chain of custody is a four-step schedule (received → converted → assigned → action
officer) so the officer can see who touched it before them. The provenance card is
headed *"Not a forward. Reproduced from the mailbox record."* — the reply must leave from
the platform or it is not on the record.
