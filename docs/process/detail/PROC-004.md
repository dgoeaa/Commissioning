## 5.10 Monitoring, audit and performance

| ID | Kind | Name | Description | Threshold | Escalation threshold | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MON-021 | Audit event | Audit event audit:correspondence-created | The governance table binds action 'create-correspondence' to the audit vocabulary 'audit:correspondence-created'. | — | — | Confirmed |
| MON-022 | Audit event | Audit event audit:triage-completed | The governance table binds action 'triage' to the audit vocabulary 'audit:triage-completed'. | — | — | Confirmed |
| MON-023 | Audit event | Audit event audit:email-converted | The governance table binds action 'convert-email' to the audit vocabulary 'audit:email-converted'. | — | — | Confirmed |

### Audit events written by this process

| Step | Audit event |
| --- | --- |
| STEP-0022 Log the correspondence | audit:correspondence-created |
| STEP-0023 Update the record | audit:triage-completed |
| STEP-0024 Turn the email into a correspondence record | audit:email-converted |

## Relationships

### Subprocesses

| ID | Name | Category | Activation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SUBPROC-001 | Assignment Desk | Sub-view of a primary workspace | — |
| SUBPROC-002 | Bulk Assignment | Sub-view of a primary workspace | — |
| SUBPROC-007 | Log the correspondence | Reusable governed write | An operator activates the control bound to this action. |
| SUBPROC-017 | Update the record | Reusable governed write | An operator activates the control bound to this action. |
| SUBPROC-060 | Turn the email into a correspondence record | Reusable governed write | An operator activates the control bound to this action. |

### Variants

| ID | Name | Kind | Differs from the primary path | Activation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VAR-001 | log the correspondence — raised from scan-intake | Channel-specific variant | The same governed action, raised from scan-intake instead of from its owner correspondence. | An operator working in scan-intake takes the action. |

### Dependencies

| ID | Supporting | Kind | Type | Direction | Mandatory | Impact if unavailable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DEP-011 | Endpoint alias DYNAMIC_ACTIONS | Integration | Runtime integration call | Outbound - the workspace calls the endpoint | Not determinable from the call site alone; the governance table states per action whether the backend is required or optional. | The call fails. Whether the operator write survives depends on whether the action declares the backend required or optional. |
| DEP-012 | Workspace registry | Process | Process handoff | Downstream - this workspace sends the operator and the selected record on | Optional: the handoff is taken only on the path that navigates. | The operator cannot complete the onward step from here; the record stays in its current state. |
| DEP-013 | Workspace bulk-assignment | Process | Process handoff | Downstream - this workspace sends the operator and the selected record on | Optional: the handoff is taken only on the path that navigates. | The operator cannot complete the onward step from here; the record stays in its current state. |
| DEP-041 | Endpoint DYNAMIC_ACTIONS | Integration | Direct HTTP call to a Power Automate flow | Outbound | Declared in the endpoint registry as a named alias. Whether a given call is mandatory is stated per action in the governance table, not here. | Every call routed through this alias fails. |

## Operational status

_No run record for this process is held among the supplied inputs. Nothing is claimed about whether it executes._
