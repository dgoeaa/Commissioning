/* The required-notification matrix: every message this estate is obliged to send.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.
 *
 * Until now the estate had a notification *inventory* and no notification *requirement*.
 * `docs/process/18-NOTIFICATION-AND-ESCALATION-CATALOGUE.md` catalogues 220 notification
 * points, but it is generated from the code by `scripts/process-discovery.mjs` — it records
 * what the artifacts happen to do, never what they owe. Its own coverage note (COV-013) says
 * as much: "220 notification points identified ... No escalation bound to a service-level
 * clock is evidenced anywhere in the supplied inputs."
 *
 * An inventory cannot answer "is anything missing", because a message that was never built
 * leaves nothing to inventory. Measured against this file instead of against itself, the
 * estate provisions eight of the thirty-three messages it owes, and of its 76 live mail
 * actions only four are addressed solely to the person concerned: 70 hard-code a fixed
 * mailbox, and two more resolve a recipient but append a fixed address alongside it.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES A ROW BELONG HERE.
 *
 * Every row is an obligation this repository already carries somewhere else — a sentence the
 * portal shows a citizen, a clock a config starts, a column a list provisions, a recipient a
 * service requires. `basis` names that obligation and `basisEvidence` cites it at file and
 * line. Nothing here is a preference, a nice-to-have, or a notification someone thought would
 * be good to have. If the obligation is withdrawn — the promise deleted, the clock removed —
 * the row goes with it, and the verifier will say so.
 *
 * `status` IS A CLAIM, NOT A SETTING.
 *
 * The `status` on each row is recomputed from the artifacts by
 * `scripts/verify-notification-matrix.mjs`, which reads the flow exports, the paste packages,
 * the runtime and the portal client and derives what the estate actually does. A row whose
 * declared status disagrees with the estate fails `npm run test:notifications`. So this file
 * cannot quietly go stale, and a fix that lands in the estate without being recorded here is
 * as much a failure as a claim recorded here without a fix.
 *
 * THE ARTIFACT SETS THIS MATRIX IS MEASURED AGAINST.
 *
 * Four sets, because no one of them is the whole estate:
 *
 *   deployed exports  docs/reference/flow-contracts/deployed         what the tenant runs today
 *   portal packages   docs/deployment/sharepoint/flows/designer-paste what Session 4 will paste
 *   internal packages docs/deployment/internal/flows/designer-paste   what Sessions 4-6 will paste
 *   clients           modules/ core/ shared/ document-portal/         what the two UIs promise
 *
 * The generated catalogue reads only the first set and a superseded fragment set under
 * `designer-paste/correspondence-gateway` — `scripts/process-discovery.mjs` line 339 hard-codes
 * that path — so it has never seen the fourteen packages the operator walkthrough deploys.
 * That blind spot is recorded as PRE-3 below rather than fixed here, because widening the
 * discovery scan regenerates all 28 process documents and renumbers every NOTIF id.

 *
 * `gates` and `qualifies` are different and the distinction is load-bearing. A gated row
 * CANNOT be provisioned while the precondition is open — there is no mechanism for it to use —
 * and `tests/notification-matrix.test.mjs` fails if one claims otherwise. A qualified row can
 * be fully provisioned and still be affected: PRE-1 does not stop a verification code being
 * sent, it leaves undecided which mailbox the public sees it come from. Collapsing the two
