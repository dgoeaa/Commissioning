/**
 * The archive scanner runs without `unzip`, and reads what `unzip` reads.
 *
 * WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS
 *
 * `tests/check-secrets.mjs` scans inside tracked archives, because an archive is text in a
 * container: `ECM_DOCS_DEV.zip` held 31 distinct signatures across 18 of its 837 members, nine
 * of which appeared in no commit and no tracked text file.
 *
 * It did that by shelling out to `unzip`, and refused to report green when `unzip` was missing —
 * correct in principle, and unrunnable in practice on Windows, where `unzip` is not on the PATH.
 * A Windows clone reported all 13 tracked archives unscannable, exited 1, and `npm run
 * commission` raised it as a blocker worded identically to a real credential leak. It was found
 * exactly that way: a verified clone, `2a9b6cd`, 1811 tracked files, reporting three blockers
 * where the same commit reports two on Linux.
 *
 * A security control that is permanently red on the most common developer platform teaches
 * people to ignore it. These assertions hold the fix in place:
 *
 *   1. The reader lists and extracts identically to `unzip`, on the real tracked archives —
 *      because a portable reader that reads DIFFERENTLY would be a silent narrowing of the
 *      control, which is worse than the failure it replaced.
 *   2. The ratchet exits 0 when `unzip` is unavailable — reproduced by shadowing it with a stub
 *      that always fails, rather than by stripping the PATH, which also breaks `git` and would
 *      fail the ratchet for the wrong reason.
 *   3. Neither `check-secrets.mjs` nor the reader shells out to `unzip` — the reader spawns
 *      nothing at all, which is what makes it immune to a missing or broken binary.
 *   4. An unreadable archive is still reported unscannable rather than skipped.
 *
 * Assertion 1 is skipped when `unzip` is not installed — there is nothing to compare against.
 * The others run everywhere, which is the point.
 *
 * Usage:  node tests/zip-reader.test.mjs
 * Exit:   0 = the control runs and reads correctly, 1 = otherwise

   * node and git, on the theory that removing `unzip` reproduces Windows. It does not. On
   * Windows a copied `git.exe` cannot find its own DLLs and libexec, so `git ls-files` — which
   * check-secrets.mjs calls on its first line of work — failed, the ratchet exited 1, and the
   * assertion reported the Windows defect as still present when it had been fixed. It was found
   * that way: `npm run commission` on a Windows clone printed `secret ratchet passes` while this
   * suite insisted the ratchet was broken.
   *
   * A test that breaks the tool it is measuring proves nothing about the tool. So the PATH is
   * left intact and `unzip` is SHADOWED instead: a stub that always exits 1 is placed first on
   * the PATH. Everything else — git above all — resolves exactly as it normally does. If the
   * ratchet still exits 0, it does not depend on unzip working, which is the actual claim.
