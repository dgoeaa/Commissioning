/**
 * One commissioning path, named in every document that looks like one.
 *
 * WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS
 *
 * A forensic pass over this baseline found **fifteen documents carrying commissioning command
 * sequences**, prescribing divergent ones, with no two agreeing on how many endpoints exist:
 * "22 of 24" in one, "17 of 24" in another, 25 in fact. Five of them recommended
 * `npm run recover`, which is retired and exits 2 because it wires a superseded estate — a
 * config that looks complete and answers 401 on every call. The most obviously-named of them,
 * `COMMISSIONING_WALKTHROUGH.md` at the repository root, is a historical audit of a different
 * tree and instructed `npm run recover` at its step 3.1 while stating elsewhere that the command
 * crashes.
 *
 * No single document was wrong in a way a reader could detect from inside it. The defect was
 * that there were fifteen, and an operator's first act — opening the one whose name matched
 * what they wanted to do — decided whether they commissioned the estate or a dead one.
 *
 * So the rule this suite enforces is not "documentation must be correct", which no test can
 * check. It is narrower and mechanical:
 *
 *   1. Exactly one document is the commissioning path, and it exists.
 *   2. Any OTHER document carrying a commissioning command sequence names it, early, where a
 *      reader sees it before following anything.
 *   3. No document presents the retired `npm run recover` as a step to run.
 *
 * A new document may still be added. It simply cannot become a twelfth silent alternative:
 * either it points at the authority, or this suite fails and says which line to add.
 *
 * Usage:  node tests/commissioning-authority.test.mjs
 * Exit:   0 = the estate has one commissioning path, 1 = otherwise
