/**
 * Does the production-readiness register cite things that exist?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * `docs/deployment/PRODUCTION_READINESS_REGISTER.json` is the answer to "what stands between this
 * estate and production", and it is only worth reading if its citations are real. A register that
 * cites a moved file or a renamed npm script degrades into a document that sounds authoritative
 * and is not — which is the exact failure mode the rest of this repository's checks exist to
 * prevent, applied to the document that describes the checks.
 *
 * So this verifies the register's own claims about the repository:
 *
 *   1. every item carries all eleven required fields, present and non-empty
 *   2. every `file` evidence reference resolves to a file that exists
 *   3. every `command` evidence reference names a script that exists in package.json
 *   4. every id is unique, and every dependency names an id in this register
 *   5. every status is one of the declared vocabulary
 *   6. targetDate is null exactly when targetDateStatus says none is established — no item may
 *      quietly acquire an estimated date
 *   7. every OPEN item in OPEN_ITEMS.md is represented here, so the register cannot silently
 *      drop one
 *
 * Check 7 is the one that matters most over time. The others catch rot; that one catches
 * omission, which is the failure a reader cannot detect by reading.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/verify-readiness-register.mjs
 *   node scripts/verify-readiness-register.mjs --check   # exit 1 on any failure

/* 8. FRESHNESS — the check whose absence let this register go stale for 38 commits.
 *
 * Revision 1.0.0 was compiled against 5831840 and not revised again while twelve live flow
 * exports were compared, all fourteen flows were verified current against the tenant, and four
 * new items arose. Every check above passed throughout: they verify that the citations resolve
 * and that no OPEN_ITEMS row is missing, and both remained true of a register describing an
 * estate that had moved on. A register that is authoritative about a state nobody re-read is
 * the exact failure the rest of this repository's checks exist to prevent, applied to the
 * document that lists them.
 *
 * The rule: evidence is dated in its own filename, and the register must be at least as new as
 * the newest evidence file AND must actually cite it. Landing evidence without folding it into
 * the register now fails the build, which is the only way this stays true.
 *
 * AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN, IN THE PART THIS CHECK COULD NOT SEE.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.7 was compiled against 5bcc913 on 2026-09-05 and stayed pinned there for 110
 * commits — while the file's own CONTENT was edited fourteen times. A reader was told the register
 * described a commit it had long stopped describing. This check was green every single day,
 * because it was blind three ways at once:
 *
 *   1. It walked two of the FOUR directories named `evidence`. The endpoint harvest wrote to the
 *      repository root, the notification work to tenant-execution/; neither was looked at.
 *   2. It matched only `^YYYY-MM-DD-` filename prefixes. The governance and endpoint work dates
 *      itself INSIDE the file (`recordedUtc`, `exportedAtUtc`, `generatedAtUtc`) or as a filename
 *      suffix — so even adding those directories would have matched nothing in them.
 *   3. It never read `compiledAgainstCommit` at all. Nothing compared it to HEAD.
 *
 * And the comparison it did make was satisfied by a TIE: the newest date-prefixed filename was
 * 2026-09-05, which is exactly `compiledUtc`. A check that passes on equality cannot distinguish
 * "just revised" from "frozen on the day the newest thing happened to land".
 *
 * All three are closed below. The commit check is the one that matters, because it needs no
 * convention to hold: whatever a future workstream calls its evidence or where it puts it, a
 * register pinned to a commit that is not HEAD is stale by inspection. */
