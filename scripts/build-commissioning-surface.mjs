 * The commissioning surface — what this baseline still needs, out of everything it holds.
 *
 *   npm run surface           # write docs/deployment/COMMISSIONING_SURFACE.md
 *   npm run surface -- --check
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * This repository tracks over 1,700 files and most of a hundred megabytes. Almost none of it is
 * what the remaining work touches. An agent or an operator handed the baseline has no way to
 * tell the difference by looking: a superseded audit and a live procedure are both markdown in
 * a docs directory, and the superseded one is often the longer and more confident of the two.
 * That is the burden — not the bytes, but the absence of a boundary, which costs a reader their
 * judgement about what is current before it costs them any disk.
 *
 * So the boundary is drawn here, and it is DERIVED rather than declared: the active surface is
 * the set of files and commands the register's OPEN items actually cite. An item closes, its
 * evidence stops being active, and this document says so on the next run. Nothing has to be
 * remembered, which is the only kind of index that survives.
 *
 * THREE STANDINGS, AND THE RULE FOR EACH
 *
 *   ACTIVE    An open item cites it. Read it as current; act on it.
 *   RETAINED  Evidence and record. True about its own date, not about today. Never edited to
 *             agree with the present — an audit rewritten when it becomes inconvenient is not a
 *             record, and the estate has already decided this for docs/audits/ and for the
 *             foundational corpus under decision D5.
 *   RETIRED   Superseded. A command that refuses to run, or a document whose instruction has
 *             been overtaken. Kept because deleting it loses the reasoning; not to be acted on.
 *
 * Nothing is deleted by this. The baseline keeps its evidence — that is the point of a baseline.
 * What changes is that a reader can now tell, without reading, which of the three they hold.

What the remaining work touches, out of everything this baseline holds. The active list is
**derived**, not declared: it is the files and commands the register's open items actually cite.
Close an item and its evidence leaves this list on the next run.

## The shape of it

| | Files | Bytes | |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **Active** | ${activePaths.length} | ${mb(bytesOf(activePaths))} | cited by an open item, or an entry point |
| **Retained** | ${retainedPaths.length} | ${mb(bytesOf(retainedPaths))} | evidence and record — true about its own date |
| Everything else | ${otherPaths.length} | ${mb(bytesOf(otherPaths))} | the two applications, their tooling, and their suites |
| **Tracked** | **${tracked.length}** | **${mb(bytesOf(tracked))}** | |

**${activePaths.length} of ${tracked.length} tracked files** are what the ${open.length} open
items point at. The rest is not clutter to be deleted — it is the evidence a baseline exists to
keep — but none of it should be read as a statement about today.

## How to read anything in this repository

| Standing | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Active** | Current. Act on it. |
| **Retained** | True about its own date. Never edited to agree with the present. |
| **Retired** | Superseded. Kept for the reasoning; not to be acted on. |

Where a document and a command disagree, **the command governs**.

---

## Where the estate stands

Register version ${reg.registerVersion}, ${reg.items.length} items —
**${reg.items.filter((i) => CLOSED.has(i.status)).length} closed, ${open.length} open**.

| Status | Items |
|---|---:|
${Object.entries(byStatus).sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]).map(([s, n]) => `| ${CLOSED.has(s) ? `**${s}**` : s} | ${n} |`).join('\n')}

Read [\`ACTION_PLAN.md\`](./ACTION_PLAN.md) for the open items in the order that unblocks the
most. Run \`npm run commission\` for the gate's own reading, and \`npm run readiness\` for the
register's.

---

## Active — commands

The ${commands.size} npm commands the open items name.

| Command | Named by |
|---|---|
${[...commands.entries()].sort().map(([c, ids]) => `| \`${c}\` | ${[...ids].sort().join(', ')} |`).join('\n')}

---

## Active — files

| Path | Cited by |
|---|---|
${activePaths.map((p) => `| [\`${p}\`](${'../../' + p}) | ${[...citedBy.get(p)].sort().join(', ')} |`).join('\n')}

---

## Retained — evidence and record

Read as a statement about its own date, never about today.

| Tree | Files | Bytes | What it is |
|---|---:|---:|---|
${RETAINED.map(([prefix, why]) => {
  const fs_ = tracked.filter((p) => p.startsWith(prefix));
  return `| \`${prefix}\` | ${fs_.length} | ${mb(bytesOf(fs_))} | ${why} |`;
}).join('\n')}

---

## Retired — not to be acted on

| | Why |
|---|---|
${RETIRED.map(([what, why]) => `| ${what} | ${why} |`).join('\n')}

---

## What holds this together

| Gate | Holds |
|---|---|
| \`npm run test:closure\` | no document presents a closed item as open, and no retired command is prescribed |
| \`npm run test:readiness\` | the register is complete, internally consistent, and no older than its newest evidence |
| \`npm run test:actions\` · \`test:runbook\` · \`test:walkthrough\` | the three generated documents against the register |
| \`npm run test:surface\` | this document against the register |
